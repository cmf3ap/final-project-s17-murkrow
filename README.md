Milestone Update:
We have the three buttons for each major feature set up on the main activity. So far, only the "Write a Review" button is partially working, the other two buttons take you to empty screens. The "Write a Review" activity allows users to select a restaurant to review, take/submit photos to go along with the review, and actually write a physical review in a text box.
